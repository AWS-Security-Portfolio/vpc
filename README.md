## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of designing and deploying a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS using Terraform. The lab focuses on network segmentation, least-privilege access, and secure connectivity through public/private subnets, a NAT gateway, and a bastion host.

## Objectives

- Create a custom VPC with public and private subnets.
- Deploy a bastion host for secure SSH access.
- Deploy an application EC2 instance in a private subnet (no public IP).
- Configure a NAT gateway to provide outbound internet for private resources.
- Apply security groups and route tables to enforce network isolation and least-privilege principles.
- Document all resources and security controls with clear evidence.

---

## Steps Performed

1. Terraform Initialization and Deployment
   - Ran terraform init and terraform apply to automate infrastructure provisioning.

2. VPC and Subnet Configuration
   - Created a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with one public and one private subnet.
   - Ensured subnets were in the correct availability zone.

3. Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway
   - Attached an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC.
   - Provisioned a NAT Gateway with an Elastic IP for outbound traffic from the private subnet.

4. Route Tables
   - Configured public route table to route 0.0.0.0/0 through IGW; associated with public subnet.
   - Configured private route table to route 0.0.0.0/0 through NAT Gateway; associated with private subnet.

5. EC2 Deployment and Security
   - Launched a bastion host in the public subnet (with public IP for SSH).
   - Launched a private EC2 instance in the private subnet (no public IP).
   - Security groups to restrict SSH: bastion only accessible from my IP, private EC2 only from bastion.

6. Connectivity Testing
   - Successfully SSHâ€™d into the bastion host, then into the private EC2 from the bastion.
